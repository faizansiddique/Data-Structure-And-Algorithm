1) Divide and Conquer algorithm
2) Recursive Algorithm
3) Uses a pivot element to partition the array into two parts
4) Elements < pivot to its left, Elements > pivot to its right
5) Pivot will be then in its correct sorted position
6) Process is now repeated from the left array & right array
7) Eventually, every element has been the pivot, so every element will be in its correct sorted position
8) As with merge sort, we'll end up partioning the array into a series of 1-element arrays
9) Does this in-place (unlike merge sort)
